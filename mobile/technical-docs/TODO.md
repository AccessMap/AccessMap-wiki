TODO (1 - probably easiest)
1. Refactor reducers so that actions are in the same file as their corresponding reducer JS file.
2. Fix UI bugs if there are any and integrate design changes as needed
4. Get the Login feature to work properly with Keycloak (debug 403 Access Denied message)
5. Allows users to create and save multiple profiles
6. Multi-modal routing (properly incorporate bus routes in route planning)
