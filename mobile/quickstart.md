# AccessMap React Native (Mobile App)
AccessMap is an open source project developed via the Taskar Center at the University of Washington. The react native app is currently runnable on Android and iOS. You may use it to plan and customize your routes by setting factors such as maximum uphill/downhill
steepness and the presence of raised curbs, or choosing one of the 3 default settings: wheelchair user, power wheelchair user, and cane user.
